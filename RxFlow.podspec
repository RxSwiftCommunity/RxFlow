  s.description  = <<-DESC
RxFlow aims to

* Promote the cutting of storyboards into atomic units to enable collaboration and reusability of UIViewControllers
* Allow the presentation of a UIViewController in different ways according to the navigation context
* Ease the implementation of dependency injection
* Remove any navigation mechanism from UIViewControllers
* Promote reactive programing
* Express the navigation in a declarative way while addressing the majority of the navigation cases
* Facilitate the cutting of an application into logical blocks of navigation
